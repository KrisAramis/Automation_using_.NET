No Geography,
The chemical brothers

If you ever change your mind about leaving it all behind
Remember, remember, no geography
If you ever change your mind about leaving it all behind
Remember, remember, no geography
Me, you and me
Him and her, and them too
And you, and me too
I'll take you along, I'll take you along with me
I'll take you along with me
I'll take you along with me
If you ever change your mind about leaving it all behind
Remember, remember, no geography
Me, you and me
Him and her, and them too
And you, and me too
I'll take you along, I'll take you along with me
I'll take you along with me
I'll take you along with me
